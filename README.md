# Introduction

The Fuller Project analyzed data from the U.S. Labor Department and various state agencies for the story [Coronavirus Shutdowns Make Women the Majority of Unemployment Seekers in States Across U.S.](https://fullerproject.org/story/coronavirus-shutdowns-make-women-the-majority-of-unemployment-seekers-in-states-across-u-s/), published April 22, 2020.

We requested weekly breakdowns of initial unemployment claims from every state, from March 1 through April 11, by gender, race, ethnicity, age, industry and occupation. Seventeen states provided some or all of the information requested, either via special request or by publishing it online. 

For a historic benchmark, we analyzed the U.S. Labor Department's ["Characteristics of the Insured Unemployed"](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/chariu.asp) data, from 1995 through 2019. This data includes state-by-state demographic, industry, and occupation breakdowns of the total number of people receiving unemployment insurance during the week of the month that includes the 19th.

#### Notes:

"Initial" claims, from the states, and "insured" claims, from the federal government, are very different measures. However, the federal government does not publish similar data on initial claims.

An individual files an **initial claim** for unemployment benefits to a state agency upon separation from an employer. But not everyone who files a claim gets approved. An individual who has already filed an initial claim and who has experienced a week of unemployment then files a **continued claim** to claim benefits for that week of unemployment. Continued claims are also referred to as "insured" unemployment.

[This article](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/04/07/how-does-unemployment-insurance-work-and-how-is-it-changing-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/) by the Brookings Institution provides a good explainer of unemployment insurance and how it has changed under the coronavirus relief measures.

State agencies did not provide consistent groupings for race and ethnicity. We standardized the groupings to conform to the federal data to the extent possible. In addition, tracking changes in the total and share of “white” applicants is problematic because the data only disaggregates totals by one characteristic at a time, separating race and ethnicity. Most Latinos choose “white” for race.
